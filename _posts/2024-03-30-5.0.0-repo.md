As Pacstall is getting closer to releasing 5.0.0, we have set up a [CI][ci-link] that runs on every commit to [master][pacstall-programs-master], which *should* handle the conversion of pre-5.0.0 scripts to 5.0.0 scripts.

If you are using the [develop][develop] branch, you can use this updated repo by replacing `/usr/share/pacstall/repo/pacstallrepo` with:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pacstall/pacstall-programs/5.0.0-master
```

When 5.0.0 is released, this branch will be merged into `master`.
