Hyprland has recently released a couple versions, and they are very tedious to keep up to date on Ubuntu, and with [hyprland-0.37.0] and its new dependency, I will be updating the package when Pacstall 5.0.0 releases, which will allow me to bundle dependencies more easily.

[hyprland-0.37.0]: https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/releases/tag/v0.37.0
