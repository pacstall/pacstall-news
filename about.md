This is the experimental Pacstall news aggregator. The goal of this is to eventually be able to simply query this site for information about changes in packages, maintainer notices, pacstall releases and upgrade instructions, etc.

### Viewing Information

For viewing information, you can either use the [website][website]{:target="_blank"}, or get your favorite RSS reader (newsboat, nom, etc), and give it the [RSS feed link][rss-link]{:target="_blank"}. One advantage of using the website however, is that you can browse posts by tags, which can be useful for locating relevant posts.


[website]: {{ site.baseurl }}/
[rss-link]: {{ "/feed.xml" | relative_url }}
